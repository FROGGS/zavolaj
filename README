Zavolaj!

This project prototypes native calling interface functionality for
Rakudo.  It should give Rakudo the ability to call out to C libraries
without having to drop to writing PIR).  The Parrot Native Call
Interface gives a similar facility in PIR.

The project name is the Slovak translation of the imperative "call!", to
complement Blizkost, a Rakudo-to-Perl-5 integration project.

MySQL

Initially the MySQL client library is being used as a test case, because
it is a popular application, is frequently asked about, and because
there is specific support for MySQL in parrot/src/nci/extra_thunks.nci.
Some of the code might become a part of the Rakudo * distribution.

The /usr/include/mysql.h file defines the mysql client library functions
and their parameters.

Prepare your system along these lines before trying out the examples:

    $ mysql -u root -p
    CREATE DATABASE zavolaj;
    CREATE USER 'testuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'testpass';
    GRANT CREATE      ON zavolaj.* TO 'testuser'@'localhost';
    GRANT DROP        ON zavolaj.* TO 'testuser'@'localhost';
    GRANT INSERT      ON zavolaj.* TO 'testuser'@'localhost';
    GRANT DELETET     ON zavolaj.* TO 'testuser'@'localhost';
    GRANT SELECT      ON zavolaj.* TO 'testuser'@'localhost';
    GRANT LOCK TABLES ON zavolaj.* TO 'testuser'@'localhost';
    GRANT SELECT      ON   mysql.* TO 'testuser'@'localhost';
    # or maybe otherwise
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON zavolaj.* TO 'testuser'@'localhost';

You can look at the results via a normal mysql connection:

    $ mysql -utestuser -ptestpass
    USE zavolaj;
    SHOW TABLES;
    SELECT * FROM nom;

SQLite3

This library cannot be called yet because of missing Parrot NCI
signatures, see the example file for details.

Testing

Before running 'make test', you *must* perform this:

    sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
    sudo apt-get install libtest-harness-perl
    export PERL6LIB=lib
