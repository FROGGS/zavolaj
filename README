Zavolaj!

This project prototypes native calling interface functionality for
Rakudo.  It should give Rakudo the ability to call out to C libraries
without having to drop to writing PIR).  The Parrot Native Call
Interface gives a similar facility in PIR.

The project name is the Slovak translation of the imperative "call!", to
complement Blizkost, a Rakudo-to-Perl-5 integration project.

MySQL 

Initially the mysql client library is being used as a fairly substantial
test case.  The result might become a useful component in the Rakudo *
release.

The /usr/include/mysql.h file defines the mysql client library functions
and their parameters.

Prepare your system along these lines before trying out the examples:

    $ mysql -u root -p
    CREATE USER 'testuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'testpass';
    GRANT CREATE ON *.* TO 'testuser'@'localhost';
    
You can look at the results via a normal mysql connection:

    $ mysql -utestuser -ptestpass
    USE zavolaj;
    SHOW TABLES;
    SELECT * FROM nom;
