Zavolaj!

This project prototypes native calling interface functionality for
Rakudo.  It should give Rakudo the ability to call out to C libraries
without having to drop to writing PIR).  The Parrot Native Call
Interface gives a similar facility in PIR.

The project name is the Slovak translation of the imperative "call!", to
complement Blizkost, a Rakudo-to-Perl-5 integration project.

Initially the mysql client library is being used as a fairly substantial
test case.  The result might become a useful component in the Rakudo *
release.
